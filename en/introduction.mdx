In this documentation you will find everything you need to integrate with the AbacatePay API. Developed by developers for developers, our platform was designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

## <Icon icon="Avocado" type="solid"/>  What is AbacatePay?

AbacatePay is a payment gateway that emerged from our own need to simplify billing in our products. We realized that existing payment methods were excessively complex:
- Extensive and confusing documentation
- Long and bureaucratic approval processes
- Multiple ways to perform the same operation
- Some gateways even require courses for integration!

Our solution? A platform that transforms the complexity of Fintechs into a simple and intuitive API. See how easy it is:

```javascript
// Example of creating a charge
const payment = await abacatePay.payments.create({
  amount: 1000,
  description: "Service provided"
});
```

Our API was built with three fundamental principles:

1. **Intent-based**: Each endpoint represents exactly what you read
   ```
   POST /billing/create    // Creates a payment
   GET /billing/get       // Searches for a specific payment
   ```

2. **Idempotent**: Execute the same request as many times as you need, without side effects
   ```javascript
   // Safe to execute multiple times
   await abacatePay.billing.create({...});
   ```

3. **Consistent**: Our API always returns an option containing the error or return data, which facilitates implementation in strongly typed languages and consistency across all operations.
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
         "id": "bill_12345667",
         "url": "https://abacatepay.com/pay/bill_12345667",
         "amount": 1000,
         "status": "PENDING",
         "devMode": true,
         "methods": ["PIX"],
         "frequency": "ONE_TIME",
         "nextBilling": null,
         "customer": {
            "id": "cust_12345",
            "metadata": {
               "email": "customer@example.com"
            }
         },
         "createdAt": "2024-11-04T18:38:28.573",
         "updatedAt": "2024-11-04T18:38:28.573",
      },
      "error": null
   }
   ```

To make it even easier, we offer official SDKs and support for development mode with dedicated API keys.
