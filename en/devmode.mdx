Dev mode is AbacatePay's development environment, designed to allow you to test all platform features safely and in a controlled manner.

## <Icon icon="flask" type="solid"/>  What is Dev mode?

When you create your AbacatePay account, it is automatically configured in Dev mode. In this environment:

- All operations are simulated
- No real transactions are processed
- You can test all features without risks
- Data is isolated from the production environment
