<Tip>
  **API Key**: Your credential to access the AbacatePay API. This key identifies your account and authorizes your requests. **IMPORTANT**: Without the API key, requests will be rejected.
</Tip> 

## <Icon icon="lock" type="solid"/>  Managing API keys

Manage your API keys directly in our platform. You can:
- List all active keys
- Create new keys
- Revoke existing keys

<Card title="Environments and API Keys" icon="book" horizontal>
  All requests are sent to the same endpoint (`https://api.abacatepay.com`), but the environment is determined by the API key used:
  - Keys created in **dev mode** process transactions in the test environment
  - Keys created in **production** process real transactions
  
  Learn more about the development environment <a href="./devmode">here</a>.
</Card>

<Card title="Authentication Error" icon="warning" horizontal>
  The API will return HTTP code `401` when:
  - The API key is not provided in the header
  - The key is invalid
  - The key has been revoked
</Card>

  * Store your keys in environment variables or secret managers

      </Card>
    </Card>
  </Step>
</Steps>

After creating your key, you can start integrating with our API. Remember to include the key in all requests in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.abacatepay.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1000}'
```

<Card title="Important Note" icon="info" horizontal>
  The same endpoint (`https://api.abacatepay.com`) is used for both development and production environments. The environment is automatically determined by the API key used in the request.
